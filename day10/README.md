# Notes, and running

Part 2 of this day was essentially integer linear programming. I did not feel like building an ILP in Zote. Therefore, I did part 2 in Python. To not have to re-do the parsing, there now is the file "parser.zote", which spits out a json representation of the data, which is then used by both p1.zote and p2.py (it should be saved as parsed.txt).
